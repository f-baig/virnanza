## Virnanza

Following the devastating and frankly boring effects of the pandemic, Virnanza brings a never seen before virtual entertainment experience! Virnanza will be the most exciting online event of the year!

### About Us

What is Virnanza you ask? Well, let me let you in on a secret. Virnanza is the greatest new virtual concert to ever grace the Earth.
Not only will it be a standalone event but Virnanza as a whole will consist of multiple companion events to other massive concerts such as Coachella. The goal od Virananza is to reinvent what it means to be a concert-goer. New opportunities at getting involved will be presented to concert-goers like never before. For example you can sing alongside your favorite stars while also staying in the comfort of your own home. After such a long isolation period due to the ongoing pandemic we all deserve a break, and Virnanza's mission is to make that break as fun as possible and accompany it with some sick tunes!

### Events

Because we have been trapped indoors so long Virnanza will incorporate both fun athome and outdoor activities!

It will be a virtual concert, that will encourage participation of its concert-goers. Revolutionary in its approach to fun, Virnanza will redfine concerts moving forwards.

There will be a section of the concert inclusing at home dancing.
This will be paired appropriately with the very engaging new concept of guest singers! Everyone that applies through social media will be eligible for the chance to sing on the big screen with their favorite artists!

Alongside this there will be interactive games played with the singers and conductors of the concert itself! Again like we cannot stop reiterating, this concert will truly redefine the role of the concert-goer in the action!
