## Virnanza

Following the devastating and frankly boring effects of the pandemic, Virnanza brings a never seen before virtual entertainment experience! Virnanza will be the most exciting online event of the year!

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/f-baig/virnanza/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
